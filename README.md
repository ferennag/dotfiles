# Introduction

This repository contains all my important dotfiles that I want to use across computers.
I am using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage the configuration files easily.

# Using the dotfiles

```
cd ~/dotfiles
stow *
```

Or you can specify which configurations you want to use:

```
stow nvim
```
